            <h1>Serving Pages from ROM</h1>
            <p>To enable Appweb to be used on an embedded system without a file system, Appweb supports the compilation of
            web pages and configuration files into C code that can be stored in Read Only Memory (ROM) and fetched by
            Appweb to respond to relevant requests.</p>
            <p>Appweb has a virtual file system interface that allows the run-time switching between serving web pages
            on a disk-based file system and a compiled ROM based store of web pages.</p>
            <p>This ROM facility may also be used to enhance security by preventing the modification of web documents,
            or in performance critical situations where the serving of web pages from memory may be an effective
            optimization.</p><a id="compilingWebPages"></a>
            <h2>Compiling Web Pages</h2>
            <p>The Appweb <b>makerom</b> program is used to compile web documents, configuration files, and any other
            files that you would like to be compiled into C code. The makerom program will parse the files and convert
            them into C data structures which can then be compiled by your C/C++ compiler and linked into your
            application.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
makerom `find web -print` &gt;romFiles.c
</pre>
            <p>This will create a list of all the web files and then convert these files into C structures in the file
            romFiles.c.</p>
            <p>The <b>makerom</b> program takes two options:</p>
            <table title="Switches" class="ui table segment">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th class="two wide">Switch</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>--prefix</td>
                        <td>Specifies a leading string prefix to remove from each of the compiled file names. Filenames
                            should be relative paths and not start with "./".
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="nowrap">-- name</td>
                        <td>Specifies the name of top level C structure. Appweb allows multiple ROM directories to be
                        included in a single application. This is necessary if using virtual hosts to allow each host
                        to have its own web directory.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>It is important to include some essential Appweb configuration files into the ROM. These include the
            Appweb configuration file, the mime.types file, and any authorization database files. The following script
            is used to compile the web pages in three web directories ("sslWeb", "vhostWeb", and "web") and to also
            compile the essential configuration files.</p>
<a id="php"></a>
            <h2>Using ROM with PHP</h2>
            <p>The ROM facility is supported by the following Appweb modules and handlers: fileHandler,
            espHandler and the sslModule.</p>
            <p>Ejscript and PHP do not support the Appweb ROM facility.</p>
