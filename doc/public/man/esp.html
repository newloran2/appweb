<b>description</b>
       the  <b>esp  </b>command  generates, manages and runs esp web applications. it
       includes a full http/1.1 web server to host your  application  but  can
       also  help  to  generate  esp  web  applications, controllers, database
       tables, and scaffolds.

       the esp command will create directories and generate configuration  and
       source code files that can then be manually edited as required.  esp is
       intelligent and will not overwrite existing files, so  you  can  safely
       edit and regenerate without losing your changes. you can overwrite your
       changes if you wish to by using the <b>--overwrite </b>switch.

<b>running esp</b>
       to run esp to serve documents from the current directory, type:
             <b>esp</b>
             # or
             <b>esp run</b>

<b>generating applications</b>
       to start a new web application, create a directory named for the appli-
       cation.  then  from that directory run <b>esp </b>to install the required sup-
       porting packs. for example:

             <b>mkdir blog</b>
             <b>cd blog</b>
             <b>esp install esp-html-mvc</b>

       this will will create a set of  directories  that  have  the  following
       meaning:

             client           - public client web content
             client/assets    - images and assets
             client/css       - client css and less style sheets
             client/index.esp - home web page
             client/paks      - extension packs
             db               - databases and scripts
             start.me         - makeme build file
             templates        - template files used when generating

       other directories will be created as needed:
             cache            - cache directory for compiled content
             db/migrations    - databases migration modules
             controllers      - server side controllers
             src              - server side main source code

       most  of  these  directories  are initially empty, but may be used over
       time. esp follows conventions where specific  files  are  stored.  this
       greatly simplifies configuring a web application.

       packs  are modules of functionality for esp applications that are pack-
       aged using the pak utility (see https://embedthis.com/pak).  packs  may
       depend  on  other packs so that installing a top level pack may install
       other required packs. for  example:  generating  the  "esp-angular-mvc"
       pack will also install: esp-angular, angular, less and more.

       see https://embedthis.com/catalog/ for a list of packs.

<b>generating migrations</b>
       migrations are generated code modules that manage portions of the data-
       base. migrations are used to create tables, initialize with  test  data
       and  optionally  destroy tables. migrations are typically generated and
       then hand-edited to  include  relevant  initialization  or  test  data.
       migrations  are  useful  to  quickly  recreate  the  database  with the
       required tables and data.

             <b>esp generate migration description table [field:type ...]</b>

       the description is used to name the migration which is created  in  the
       <b>db/migrations </b>directory. a migration is given a unique ordered sequence
       number and the description is appended to this number. the  description
       is  mapped  where spaces are changed to "_" characters. when migrations
       are run, they are run in sequence number order.

       if field:type values are supplied, the database migration will  include
       code to create a column for each specified field of the requested type.
       the valid database types are:  blob,  boolean,  date,  float,  integer,
       string, and text.

<b>generating tables</b>
       to generate a database table without creating a migration:

             <b>esp generate table table [field:type ...]</b>

<b>generating controllers</b>
       controllers   are  the  primary  mechanism  for  responding  to  client
       requests.  to generate a controller, run:

             <b>esp generate controller name [actions...]</b>

       this will create a controller of the requested name. it will  create  a
       controller  source  file  in the <b>controllers </b>directory. if action names
       are requested, the controller source will define an action  method  for
       each  name.  you  can edit the controller source to meet your needs. it
       will not be overwritten unless you specify the --overwrite switch.

<b>generating scaffolds</b>
       a scaffold is a generated controller, database  migration,  client-side
       controller  and set of views that provides add, edit and list function-
       ality for the database table.  scaffolds are useful to quickly generate
       chunks  of the application and prototype web pages and actions for man-
       aging a database table.  to generate a scaffold:

             <b>esp generate scaffold model [field:type ...]</b>

       this will create a scaffold for the specified database table  and  will
       generate a controller of the same name.

       if field:type values are supplied, a database migration will be created
       with code to create a column for each specified field of the  requested
       type.  the  valid database types are: blob, boolean, date, float, inte-
       ger, string, and text. the migration will use  the  name  "create_scaf-
       fold_model" and will be created under the <b>db/migrations </b>direcvtory.

       the  scaffold  will  include an edit action and view page that provides
       add and edit capability. the list action and view, provides the ability
       to list the table rows and select an entry to edit.

       if  the --singleton switch is ues, the controller will be generated for
       a singleton resource and will not have a list action.

<b>compiling</b>
       esp compiles controllers and esp pages native  code  shared  libraries.
       these  are  then  loaded  and run by esp in response to incoming client
       requests. code is compiled only once but can be run many times to  ser-
       vice incoming requests.

       in  development  mode, esp will automatically compile the relevant por-
       tions of the application if the source code is modified. it can  intel-
       ligently  recompile  controllers  and  esp pages. however, you can also
       explicilty recompile portions or the complete appliction  via  the  esp
       command.

       esp can recompile everything via:

             <b>esp compile</b>.

       this will re-compile all esp resources.

       esp  also  provides options for you to individually compile controllers
       and esp pages. to recompile named pages or controllers:

             <b>esp compile path/*.esp...</b>.

            the arguments after "compile"  are  pathname  filters.  these  are
            resolved  relative  to  the current directory. only items matching
            the filter pathnames are compiled.

       to compile the entire application and produce a single combined  shared
       library  file,  set  the  "http.content.combine"  property in the pack-
       age.json file, to include "c" files. this is typically achieved by set-
       ting  the  esp mode to release which selects the release profile in the
       package.json.

<b>authentication</b>
       esp can use the system password database or it can define passwords  in
       the package.json or in an application database.  to define passwords in
       the package.json, use:

        <b>esp user add username password roles...</b>

       to define authentication roles, use:

         <b>esp role add abilities...</b>

<b>cross-compiling</b>
       to compile for a target system of a different  architecture,  you  must
       specify  the  target.   to do this, use the -platform switch to specify
       the target architecture. specify the path to the platform directory  in
       the appweb source code built for that platform.

            <b>esp -platform /home/dev/linux-arm-debug compile</b>

<b>mode</b>
       the <b>esp mode </b>command will retrieve and display the "esp.mode" property.
       the <b>esp mode debug </b>command will modify the "esp.mode" property and  set
       it to the "debug" value.  the <b>esp release </b>command will set the esp.mode
       to "release".

<b>running</b>
       to run your application:

             <b>esp run</b>

<b>cleaning</b>
       to clean all generated module files:
             <b>esp clean</b>

<b>migrations</b>
       migration files can be run via the <b>esp migrate </b>command. with  no  other
       parameters,  the command will run all migrations that have not yet been
       applied to the database. you can also use <b>esp migrate forward </b>to  apply
       apply the next unapplied migration. similarly <b>esp migrate backward </b>will
       reverse the last applied migration. you can also use <b>esp migrate nnn </b>to
       migrate  forward  or backward to a specific migration, where nnn is the
       migration sequence number at the start of the migration file name.

<b>commands</b>
       esp has the following command usage patterns:

             esp clean
             esp compile
             esp compile controllers name
             esp compile path/*.esp
             esp generate app name
             esp generate controllers name [action [, action] ...]
             esp generate scaffold model [field:type [, field:type] ...]
             esp generate table name model [field:type [, field:type] ...]
             esp run
             esp run 4000
             esp mode debug

<b>options</b>
       <b>--appweb configfile</b>
             use the specified appweb config file to define and host  the  esp
             application.  by default the esp command looks for a package.json
             and uses that to define the applicaiton.

       <b>--database database provider</b>
             use the specified database provider. set to "mdb"  or  "sdb"  for
             sqlite.

       <b>--genlink slink.c</b>
             generate  a  static  link  initialization  file for esp pages and
             applications.  this is used with --static to generate  a  appweb-
             staticinitialize()  function  that will invoke all esp initializ-
             ers.   by  default,  appweb   expects   this   to   be   in   the
             src/server/slink.c file.

       <b>--home dir</b>
             change the current working directory before beginning processing.

       <b>--keep</b>
             keep intermediate source files in the cache directory. this over-
             rides the espkeepsource setting in the appweb.conf file.

       <b>--listen [ip:]port</b>
             define  the  listening  endpoint  address. this will be used when
             generating an application. the value will  be  patched  into  the
             generated appweb.conf configuration file.

       <b>--log logfile:level</b>
             specify  a  file  to  log  messages.   the syntax is: <b>"--log log-</b>
             <b>name[:loglevel]"</b>.  level 3 will trace the  request  and  response
             headers.

       <b>--nodeps</b>
             do not install or upgrade dependencies.

       <b>--noupdate</b>
             do not update package.json.

       <b>--optimize</b>
             compile optimized without debug symbols.

       <b>--overwrite</b>
             overwrite  existing  files.  ejsweb  normally  will not overwrite
             existing files. this is to preserve user  changes  to  previously
             generated files.

       <b>--quiet</b>
             suppress diagnostic trace to the console.

       <b>--platform [path/]os-arch-profile</b>
             target platform configuration to build for and directory contain-
             ing appweb objects and libraries for the target platform.   if  a
             path is supplied, the specified platform directory is used.  oth-
             erwise, esp searches from the current  directory  upwards  for  a
             parent platform directory.

       <b>--rebuild</b>
             force  a  recompile  of all items when used with the compile com-
             mand.  when used with migrate, this will  recreate  the  database
             and apply all migrations.

       <b>--routename name</b>
             this  selects  the appweb route by name that will be used for the
             esp configuration. routes can be given an explicit name  via  the
             "name" appweb.conf directive. otherwise routes are named by their
             route pattern.

       <b>--routeprefix prefix</b>
             this selects the appweb route by prefix that will be used for the
             esp configuration. routes can be given an explicit prefix via the
             "prefix" appweb.conf directive. if  the  route  prefix  does  not
             match,  the  first portion of the route pattern is tested against
             the requested prefix.

       <b>--single</b>
             generate a controller for a singleton resource instead of a group
             of resources. a singleton controller omits a list action.

       <b>--static</b>
             use  static  linking  when building esp applications. this causes
             esp to create archive libraries instead of shared libraries.

       <b>--symbols</b>
             compile for debug with symbols.

       <b>--table name</b>
             override the database table name when generating  tables,  migra-
             tions or scaffolds. this is useful to request a plural version of
             the model name. alternatively, specify the model name when gener-
             ating  the  scaffold,  table or migration with the desired plural
             suffix. for example: "-s" or "-ies".

       <b>--trace tracefile:level</b>
             specify a file for trace messages.  the syntax is: <b>"--trace  tra-</b>
             <b>cename[:tracelevel]"</b>.    level  3  will  trace  the  request  and
             response headers.

       <b>--verbose </b>or <b>-v</b>
             run in verbose mode and trace actions to the console.

       <b>--why </b>or <b>-w</b>
             explain why a resource was or was not compiled.
